# Mogu: a Collection of Simple Numerical Routines

This is a numerical packages collecting various routines of numerical algorithms. This is not only for convenience, but also demonstration.

I tried to make each file to be independent of each other. If there are functions that are universally used, they will be put into the package `mogu.util`. However, I try my best to keep the number of these functions as few as possible.

# Functionalities

* Association rule using Apriori algorithm;
* Embedding: Sammon algorithm;
* Binomial tree algorithm for European and American options pricing;
* Exponential and sigmoid curve fitting;
* Simulated voltage for networks;
* Voter rank: Wilson's score.
